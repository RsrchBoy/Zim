===== Hacking Zim =====

* Documentation

You can find the documentation in the source package under "./share/zim/doc/"
This includes not only the user manual but also the development documents.

Of course each of the perl modules also contain POD documentation that
describes the API of each class.

* Running zim from the source directory

While hacking you want to be able to run zim without installing it. You can
just call "./bin/zim" from the source directory and it will find the libs
and config files included in the source dir instead of the system defaults.

* Testing

It is good practise to add tests for any new features you implement or for
any bugs that you are fixing. Please have a look at all the tests in "./t/"
for examples on how to test various things.

Run "./Build test" to run the whole test suite. Another very usefull tool
is the test coverage report. Run "./Build testcover" to see which parts of the
code are covered by tests.
