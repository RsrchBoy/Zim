====== Installing Zim ======

===== Installation =====

To install **zim** unpack the archive, change directory and run:

'''
perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install
'''

Detailed installation instructions are available for:

* [[.unix|Linux and other unix flavors]]
* [[.windows|Windows]]
* [[.OS X|OS X]] 

==== Testing ====
When you have tests failing please run in verbose mode before reporting, there are warnings there for tests known to fail occasionally.

'''
./Build test verbose=1
'''

==== Run without install ====
You don't need to install **zim** to run it. Just unpack the source and go to the package directory. Now run ''./bin/zim'' and **zim** will find it's files relative to the package directory. This is useful when testing a new version or when you lack the rights to do a proper installation.
