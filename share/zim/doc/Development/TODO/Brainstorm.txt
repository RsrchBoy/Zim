====== Brainstorm ======
This page contains a number of suggestions that are //not// on the [[TODO]] list. Maybe they will be on the list for version 2.0, maybe they will be implemented as a plugin - who knows.

See also: http://live.gnome.org/Tomboy/PlaceForNewIdeas they have some good ideas as well.
	

* Archive plugin
	* Add "Archive" action next to Delete
	* Add property to page to hide it from the side pane
		* needs headers - see [[wiki_format]]
	* also mark read only ?

* Have a look at a plugin to sync with dokuwiki
	* get page
	* check timestamp
	* upload page

* Have a look at a rsync plugin

* plugin to show a [[ToC]] in the top of the side pane
	* add "get_headers" or "get_index" to Page.pm
	* hook to "load page"
	* put anchors at each header
	* allow linking to anchors

* tickets
	* simple forms - doable
	* backend doesn't matter
	* reports
		* table view - doable
		* hash certain meta propertises - doable
		* link in entry boxes - further studie needed
			* or use list view for things that are linkable
	* attachement - no prob.

* menuitem //tools//->//selection//
	* pops open dialog with treeview
	* add pages with drag / drop
	* "add current page" button
	* "save selection" button
		* saves to page
	* how to re-open the dialog for a certain page ?
	* short cut to open a certain selection would do away with request for bookmark feature
	* should history / recent pages be special selection ?

* for list view inspiration see: http://taskcoach.sourceforge.net
	* in page list view with color coding for page properties
	* each item links to a page

* it should be possible to use globs in the linking structure. For example if I want to link a birth date to each occance of that day for each year.
	* add linking type or relation "birthday" to the link
	* make date pages __implicit backlink searches__
	* by default namespace dates by year in new installations

* Context menu items for index
	* "split" split page to namespace (each heading its own page)
	* "merge" include namespace content in a single page

* Inserting an anchor with ''<ctrl>M''
	* show a small icon, not unlike a break point in IDEs
	* offer the possibility to attach a footnote to the anchor
		* change the icon if a note was attached
	* give the anchor an ID that can be linked from the outside

* Plugin for VI escape mode
	* opens up many keys for special editing actions
	* should not conflict with modeless editing
	* option to choose module: simple mode or vi-like mode
		* see opengroup posix spec
		* see http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/quickref.html 
	* export a list of textviews somewhere to which the plugin can bind

* Gnome VFS support
	* use a plugin for this

* A plugin that adds a "publish" action to the menu
	* state "published" should be shown per page
	* specify html template and directory for publishing
	* remove links to unpublished pages ??

* Make folding lists, "in page" outlining

* make it possible to customize the toolbar

* Internal references (images, tables, footnotes, ...)
	* anonymous links ?
	* dynamic numbering
	* each referenced item should have a unique id
		* map id to table record
		* map id to new page
		* let formatter number these ids on export
	* footnotes could be displayed in seperate pane below normal text
		* or in seperate window
