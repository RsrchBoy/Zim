====== GUI improvements ======

* add profile drop down to properties
* Make trayicon show icons for open notebooks ?
* make open notebook dialog show paths and show open notebooks in bold, optionally include icons as well
* Better feedback from autosave and ^S for "paranoid" users
* Set sensitivity for next/prev/child when applicable
* optional bottom pane with iconview showing attachments may be nice


* Fix bug in redo with the edit mode
	* chars without markup behind e.g. bold region can become bold after redo
* group user actions for atomic undo/redo of auto-formatting actions
* rich copy-paste between zim instances
* rich copy-paste to e.g. abiword, open-office, ..
* class based style sheets
	* don't add more types of tags, just (sub)class them (h1 - h5 should be subclass of "h")
	* dialog to modify this stylesheet file
* Listing available languages for spell checking not possible at this point (will be in gtkspell3)
	* therefor make it a text input, defaulting to locale
	* add this to repository / page properties

	* allow updating links to files/urls/etc. as well
* trigger "parse_word" at , . ; " ' ) etc.
* trigger "parse_word" on move cursor
* render "<hr>" elements
* Make bullet lists indent properly so line wrapping looks better
* Search dialog could have page selection all/pages (like export has)
