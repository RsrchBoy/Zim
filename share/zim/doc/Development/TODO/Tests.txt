====== Tests ======

Look at coverage overview. Some suggestions:

* Add test for links parsing logic in copy media when exporting
	* loop trough Html to see if paths remain OK
	* both with and without doc_root
	* rel path, abs path and uri
	* both for images and file links
* Expand test coverage for Zim.pm - copy tests that are now only done for Files
* Test coverage for Formats/Wiki and Formats/Html

* test initialization of dir and related files for notebook
	* dir type
	* VCS
	* slow_fs
* test rename case-sensitive from GUI
	* test in place for backend, just need to make sure GUI doesn't resolve
* walk through UI actions to see what could be tested
* test navigation back / forw / prev / next / up / down
* test filename lookup with utf8 chars in filename
* test utf8 content in page
* test list_page with utf8 file names and utf8 content
* test list_pages with corrupted utf8 names / content
* test list_links and list_backlinks
