====== Export ======

API for export seems a bit messy. Can we simplify ?

Improvements for the export feature:

* **Export to single file**
	* needs a close / commit / DESTROY call
* Export option for "Follow links"
* Export should warn about dead internal links (or remove them)

* make ToC logic in Selection available in API
	* InsertToC plugin which can include lists of links in a page
	* print/printToBrowser the outline (left panel)

* add "update" (= compare mtime) to commandline export interface ?

* Make export use [[selections]]
