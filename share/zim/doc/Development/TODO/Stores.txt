====== Stores ======

**Gjots** derives from Store directly and loads everything in memory.

Would like a **MultiPartFile** store that uses a single file in multipart mime style but uses cache to save parts as not to write the whole file all the time. Does this make sense ?

Then we would have a derived class **FlatMultiPartFile**  that uses a single
file per namespace but still uses dirs to get sub namespaces. This is the
format the [[AlbumPlugin]] would use.

Also consider how **XML** could encode multiple pages in a single file.
