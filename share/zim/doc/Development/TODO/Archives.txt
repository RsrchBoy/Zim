* ~~Make bin/zim 	pass file names as repository~~
* Make zim match files
	* for tar.* call Zim::FS::Tar, no VCS
	* for gjots use Store::Gjots as top level
		* how to set dir ?
		* disable writing history / cache because multiple files share same dir
* Add Zim::FS::Tar class
	* read only dir that calls the tar command
	* file objects subclass buffer and set to read-only as well
* After constructign the Tar dir find the "notebook.zim" file to strip directory prefix and create subdir to use for store
* Figure out how to do caching for these arhives
	* Obviously need to use cache from archive if possible
	* Copy to xdg-cache dir and use from there
	* If not available initialize cache from tar file list
		* page lookups should use the cache when possible
	* need --build-index switch to be able to compile index before pacakging a notebook
* If all this works, package zim manual as tar.gz to save space

Do use external calls to gnu tar instead of usign e.g. Archive::Tar because tar is faster and does not read whole archive in memory.
