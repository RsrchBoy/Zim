===== Typed links =====

Make it possible to have a type on a link. This creates triplets of nodes like in RDF.

In www jargon the "rel" property is used for typed links, "type" is reserved for mime.
See http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#h-6.1 for examples of possible types.

For zim put the pages related as Next / Prev / Parent / Index / ... could have special types like "_Next", "_Prev" etc.

Embedded images are special links - should fit into type framework.
Similar for inclusion of paragraphs from other docs or pages.

Annotations would be like "reversed" links where the end-point links to the origin.
Even this can be covered with a type or a property of a type.
In WWW jargon we have a "rev" property complementary to "rel".

Of course type would be part of the [[caching|cache]]. [[Searching|Search]] functionality should be able to use the type of the link in the query.
