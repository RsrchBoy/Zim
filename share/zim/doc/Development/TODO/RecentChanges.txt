A Recent Changes page is typically a special page that shows an edit history of the wiki.

In zim this should be a dialog giving a list of pages with modification time, creation time (?) and the user that did the last modification.

We can do this simply using the file system timestamps, but that is error prone. More robust would be to include this information as [[headers]] in the files (and index it in the [[caching|cache]]). This is the way to go.

Of course once we start using version control we would want to integrate with it. However this could be difficult since most VCS don't have a command to generate this kind of listing. Version control systems typically give a history of the whole repository or of a single file, but not of a selection of files sorted by latest revision.
