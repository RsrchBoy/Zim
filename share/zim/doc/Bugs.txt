====== Bugs ======

**Zim** uses the [[https://bugs.launchpad.net/zim/|launchpad bug tracker]] to collect bug reports. You can check there for problems under active development and submit new bugs. If you are not sure about a bug or you have a more general suggestion feel free to mail pardus@cpan.org.

==== Current Bugs and Problems ====
* A number of menu items are made insensitive when focus shifts away from the TextView, this is a temporary hack.

==== Known Issues / Limitations ====
* Zim does not detect when the desktop or X server exits and therefore does not save it's state when it is killed.
* Files are always expected to have utf8 content, there is no character set detection.
* Horizontal scrolling doesn't handle long verbatim lines correctly. Probably a bug in the gtk+ TextView widget.
* Selections do not always behave as expected, this is a Gtk+ issue
	* http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=333514
* The about dialog does not close for certain versions of Gtk+, this is a Gtk+ issue.
