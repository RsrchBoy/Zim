===== Patches =====

The simple way to create patches is to download the source tar ball for the latest release. After you are done hacking take a diff (use "''diff -rwu''") and mail it to pardus@cpan.org.

If you want the full revision controlled source tree you will need the [[http://bazaar-vcs.org/|Bazaar version control system]]. To check out the current tree from launchpad run:

	$ bzr branch lp:zim

This will give you a local copy to hack on. When working on a large feature please commit changes to your local branch regularly so we have a detailed log of what changed later on. When you are done just run:

	$ bzr send -o some-description.patch

and mail the resulting file to pardus@cpan.org. This file contains the whole patch set and can easily be merged in the upstream repository.

===== Contact =====

To join the zim mailing list you need to join the "[[https://launchpad.net/~zim-wiki|zim-wiki]]" team in launchpad. This mailing list is used for synchronizing releases and the occasional brainstorm session. But feel free to mail all your comments, questions and rants [[pardus@cpan.org|mail to me]] personally.
