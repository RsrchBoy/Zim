====== Installing Zim on Linux or Unix ======

This page describes how to install Zim manually on a Linux or Unix system. A number of Linux distributions have standard packages for Zim now, using these is usually the easiest.

===== Dependencies =====

==== Perl ====
You need to have perl 5.8.0 or newer installed. This is a standard package in almost any distribution.

==== Gtk+ ====
This program uses the gtk+ toolkit version 2.4 or newer.
It is NOT backward compatible with gtk+ 2.0 and 2.2.

==== Gtk-Perl ====
You can install the Glib and Gtk2 perl modules from [[http://search.cpan.org|CPAN]], however check if your distribution has standard packages for this first, this will usually be much easier.

==== CPAN modules ====
You will need the perl modules listed below, all of these are available from [[http://search.cpan.org|CPAN]]. Some may already be installed on your system. When you run "''perl Build.pl''" (see below) the build script will tell you what you are missing.

	Module::Build
	Test::More

	POSIX
	Encode
	IO::File
	File::Spec
	File::Copy

	File::BaseDir
	File::MimeInfo
	File::DesktopEntry

Optional modules used by plugins:

	Gtk2::TrayIcon
	Gtk2::Spell    (requires gtkspell)

To install a module from CPAN you can run the following command:

	perl -MCPAN -e "install foo::bar"

===== Installing Zim =====

To install using only perl:

	$ perl Build.PL
	$ ./Build
	$ ./Build test
	$ ./Build install

or if you have GNU Make available, you can try:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install

For more information about install targets etc. see the
documentation for the [[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Build|Module::Build]] perl module.
