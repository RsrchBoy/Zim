====== Plugins ======

To enable or disable plugins, check or un-check them in the [[preferences|Preferences dialog]] and restart **zim**.

There are a couple of plugins packaged with the default installation:

==== Calendar ====
Plugin that adds a calendar widget to zim linking each day to a page in a special namespace. This plugin is intended for keeping journals etc.

To control the look of a page in the date namespace edit the template "''_Date.txt''" in "''templates/wiki/''".

==== TODO List ====
Plugin to add a dialog with TODO items. See [[.TODOList|TODOList]] for details.

==== Tray Icon ====
This plugin shows an icon in the system tray and enables a "hide to tray" feature. This can be particularly useful when you want to have zim running at all times. This plugin also modifies the behavior of the "''--iconify''" [[commandline]] switch. This allows you to start zim in the system tray.

When you are running a gtk+ version < 2.10 the tray icon plugin will need the ''Gtk2::TrayIcon'' perl module to function. This can also be the case if your gtk+ is up to date, but the Gtk2 perl bindings were compiled against an older version.

You can choose to have only one trayicon or to have a trayicon per notebook. To enable this second option you need to edit the [[config]] file manually. When you have an icon per notebook you can have a different icon image per notebook, see [[properties]].

==== Spell Checking ====
The spell checking plugin needs the ''Gtk2::Spell'' perl module, which in turn needs the gtkspell package. 

TODO: still needs controls to change the language of the spell checking. You can set the language in the [[config|config file]].

==== Print To Browser ====
This plugin is added to fill the gap of lacking printing support in zim. It adds a "print to browser" menu item (keybinding ''^P'') which does actually an export of the current page to html and opens the html file in your browser. If your browser does have printing support pressing ''^P'' twice should send the current page to your printer.

The PrintToBrowser plugin uses the Html template called "Print". To customize this template you can create "''~/.local/share/zim/templates/html/Print.html''". See [[templates]] for more details.

==== Equation Editor ====
This plugin allows you to insert equations into a page using latex. See [[.EquationEditor|EquationEditor]] for details.

==== Insert Screenshot ====
Adds a menu item for "Insert screenshot". Depends on an external program called "''scrot''".

==== ToggleReadOnly ====
This plugin adds a toolbar button that allows you to toggle the notebook to read-only mode. This can protect you from accidental edits while browsing your notes.

==== VersionControl ====
This plugin tries to detect which version control system you are using and loads advanced controls for that specific backend. See [[VersionControl]] for general version control support.
