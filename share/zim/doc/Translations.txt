====== Translations ======

The easiest way to contribute translations is to go to the [[https://launchpad.net/zim|launchpage website]]. Here you can colaborate with others to translate zim into your native language.

If you rather use offline tools like [[http://www.poedit.net/|poedit]] you can either download the latest translation template or partial translation from launchpad or checkout the source repository for zim (see [[Contributing]] for details on that).

==== Testing translations ====

Zim using the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/|GNU gettext]] tool chain for translations. The source package contains a "''zim.pot''" file which is the template. The directory "''po/''" contains translations, which are named "''po/language.po''" or "''po/language_COUNTRY.po''" where "language" and "COUNTRY" are the respective language and country codes for the locale.

To compile a new translation run:

	$ perl Lingua.pl

This will add all ''.po'' files to the zim source. Now run zim from the source directory using:

	$ LANG=language_COUNTRY ./bin/zim

When done translating [[pardus@cpan.org|mail me]] the new .po file for inclusion in the next release.
