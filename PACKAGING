===== Packaging =====

Some tips for packagers:

=== Compiling ===

Since perl is written in perl completely there is little to compile. The build
action mainly figures out which files to install.

However some config files and translations are "compiled" when building.

=== Installing ===

When creating a binary package you typically you need to install to a directory
that is zipped into the package. You can use:

	./Build install --install_base /my/path

to install to a package directory. Have a look at the Module::Build
documentation for more advanced stuff.

=== Post actions ===

If you use the freedesktop.org mime and application databases you need to run
update actions after installing zim. When you run install from the source
build these actions are run automatically, but I guess you will need to include
them in a package as a post action:

To make sure zim is listed in the applications menu run:

	update-desktop-database

To make sure the mimetype for zim notebooks is installed run:

	update-mime-database /usr/share/mime

And to ensure the mimetype has an icon run:

	xdg-icon-resource install --context mimetypes --size 64 \
	./share/pixmaps/zim.png text-x-zim-notebook
